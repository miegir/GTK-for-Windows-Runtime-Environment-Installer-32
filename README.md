======================================================

[![Github Downloads All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/meigir/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer-32/total.svg)](https://github.com/miegir/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer-32/releases)

This repository is a fork of the  [GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment Installer: 64-bit](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer) that was originally forked from the repository by Alexander Shaduri.
My efforts here will focus on creating a **32-bit version** of the GTK+-3 runtime, with only the subset of the 32-bit libraries that are needed by me.

I only support gtk3-runtime.ts.nsi from which the installer can be compiled using [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download).

The installers can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/miegir/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer-32/releases).
